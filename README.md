# Weather_Predictor
this repo contains code for the implementation of the weather predictor app
This GitHub repository contains the code for a weather prediction application. The main components include:

1. `app.py`: The main Python file that likely contains the application logic and routes for the web application.
2. `Weather_Predictor.h5`: A pre-trained machine learning model file, likely used for making weather predictions.
3. `scaler.pkl`: A pickle file containing a pre-trained scaler object, likely used for data preprocessing.
4. `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python packages and dependencies for the application.
5. `README.md`: A markdown file providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
6. `LICENSE`: A file containing the open-source license information for the project.

The repository seems to be a Python-based web application that utilizes machine learning models to predict weather conditions. It includes the necessary files for deploying and running the application, as well as the pre-trained models and data preprocessing components.
